A fundamental question regarding music processing is its degree of independence from speech processing, in terms of their underlying neuroanatomy and influence of cognitive traits and abilities. Although a straight answer to that question is still lacking, a large number of studies have described where in the brain and in which contexts (tasks, stimuli, populations) this independence is, or is not, observed. We examined the independence between music and speech processing using functional magnetic resonance imagining and a stimulation paradigm with different human vocal sounds produced by the same voice. The stimuli were grouped as Speech (spoken sentences), Hum (hummed melodies), and Song (sung sentences); the sentences used in Speech and Song categories were the same, as well as the melodies used in the two musical categories. Each category had a scrambled counterpart which allowed us to render speech and melody unintelligible, while preserving global amplitude and frequency characteristics. Finally, we included a group of musicians to evaluate the influence of musical expertise.
